## User Flow Changes

### OLD Flow (Before):
```
Seller:
1. Complete KYC Tier 2 → Properties become visible → Receive interests & offers

Buyer:
1. Complete KYC Tier 2 → Can see properties → Can show interest & make offers
```

### NEW Flow (After):
```
Seller:
1. Complete KYC Tier 1 → Properties become visible → Receive interest notifications
2. Complete KYC Tier 2 → Can receive & accept offers

Buyer:
1. Complete KYC Tier 1 → Can see properties → Can show interest
2. Complete KYC Tier 2 → Can make offers
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Onboarding**: Properties visible immediately after basic KYC
2. **More Engagement**: Buyers can browse and show interest with Tier 1
3. **Better Conversion**: Sellers receive interest notifications earlier
4. **Maintained Security**: Actual transactions still require Tier 2
5. **Clearer Progression**: Users understand what each tier unlocks

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Tier 1 Seller**: Verify property is visible after approval
2. **Tier 1 Buyer**: Verify can browse properties and show interest
3. **Tier 2 Requirement**: Verify offers require Tier 2 for both parties
4. **Interest Notifications**: Verify sellers receive notifications at Tier 1
5. **UI Messages**: Verify all messages correctly reflect new requirements
