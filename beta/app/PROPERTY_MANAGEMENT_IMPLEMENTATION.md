# Property Management System Implementation

This document outlines the complete property management system that has been implemented for the caenhebo-alpha real estate platform.

## Overview

The property management system allows sellers to list properties, buyers to search and view properties, and administrators to manage property compliance. The system runs on **http://155.138.165.47:3004**.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **Property Model**: Complete property model with fields for code, title, description, location, price, features, and compliance status
- **Property Interest Model**: Tracks buyer interest in properties
- **Compliance Status**: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED statuses
- **Property Codes**: Unique auto-generated codes (e.g., CAE-2024-0001)

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Property Creation (Sellers)
- **POST** `/api/properties/create`
- Creates new property listings
- Requires seller role and KYC approval
- Auto-generates unique property codes
- Sets initial status to PENDING

#### Property Listing (Sellers)
- **GET** `/api/properties`
- Returns seller's own properties with statistics
- Includes interest count and transaction count
- Admin access returns all properties

#### Property Search (Buyers)
- **GET** `/api/properties/search`
- Search by property code or filters
- Only shows APPROVED properties to buyers
- Includes buyer interest status

#### Property Interest (Buyers)
- **POST** `/api/properties/interest`
- Allows buyers to express interest
- Prevents duplicate interests
- Prevents self-interest (seller can't be interested in own property)

#### Admin Compliance Management
- **PUT** `/api/admin/properties/compliance`
- Approve or reject property listings
- Add compliance notes
- Set admin valuation price

### 3. User Interface Components

#### Seller Dashboard (`/seller/dashboard`)
- **Enhanced Statistics**: Real property data instead of static zeros
- **List New Property Button**: Direct navigation to property creation
- **Manage Properties Button**: Navigate to property management
- **Property Stats**: Live counts of listings, offers, and interested buyers

#### Property Listing Form (`/seller/properties/new`)
- **Complete Form**: All property details including location, price, features
- **Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation
- **Success Feedback**: Shows generated property code
- **Auto-redirect**: Returns to dashboard after successful creation

#### Property Management (`/seller/properties`)
- **Property Grid**: Visual cards showing all seller properties
- **Status Badges**: Clear compliance status indicators
- **Statistics**: Interest count and offer count per property
- **Actions**: View and edit options (edit disabled for approved properties)

#### Property Search (Buyer Dashboard)
- **Search Form**: Property code input with validation
- **Direct Navigation**: Automatically navigates to property detail page
- **KYC Protection**: Disabled until buyer completes KYC

#### Property Detail Page (`/property/[code]`)
- **Complete Property Info**: All details, images, location
- **Interest System**: Express interest button for buyers
- **Statistics**: Shows interest count and offer count
- **Role-based Access**: Different views for buyers, sellers, and admins
- **Property Verification**: Only shows approved properties

#### Admin Compliance Management
- **Property Overview**: Statistics dashboard showing pending/approved/rejected counts
- **Review Interface**: Detailed property review with approval/rejection actions
- **Compliance Notes**: Add notes when approving or rejecting
- **Admin Valuation**: Set independent property valuation
- **Batch Actions**: Review multiple properties efficiently

### 4. Security & Access Control

#### Role-based Access
- **Sellers**: Can create and manage their own properties
- **Buyers**: Can search and view approved properties, express interest
- **Admins**: Can view and manage all properties, handle compliance

#### KYC Requirements
- **Property Creation**: Sellers must complete KYC to list properties
- **Property Search**: Buyers must complete KYC to search properties
- **Interest Expression**: Buyers must complete KYC to express interest

#### Data Protection
- **Property Visibility**: Only approved properties visible to buyers
- **Owner Protection**: Property owner details not exposed to buyers
- **Interest Privacy**: Interest data protected between parties

### 5. Property Compliance Workflow

1. **Seller Lists Property**: Creates property with PENDING status
2. **Admin Review**: Admin reviews property details and documents
3. **Compliance Decision**:
   - **APPROVED**: Property becomes visible to buyers
   - **REJECTED**: Seller receives feedback via compliance notes
4. **Buyer Discovery**: Approved properties searchable by property code
5. **Interest Expression**: Buyers can express interest in approved properties

### 6. Property Code System
- **Format**: CAE-YYYY-XXXX (e.g., CAE-2024-0001)
- **Uniqueness**: Auto-incremented sequential numbers
- **Year-based**: Includes current year for organization
- **Searchable**: Primary search mechanism for buyers
